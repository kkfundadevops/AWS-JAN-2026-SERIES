# AWS SERIES 

## AWS Fundamentals & Cloud Basics

---

## 1. Course Introduction & Learning Objective

This AWS series is designed to build a **strong cloud foundation** before moving into advanced AWS, and real-time production use cases.

### Why start with fundamentals?

Most learners jump directly into services like EC2 or S3 without understanding:

* Why cloud exists
* How AWS is structured internally
* Who is responsible for what
* How services connect together

This leads to:

* Misconfigurations
* Security issues
* Unexpected billing
* Weak interview answers

This day focuses on **conceptual clarity**, which becomes the backbone for all future AWS services.

---

## 2. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of **compute, storage, networking, and databases** over the internet on a **pay-as-you-use** model.

Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers:

* Resources are rented
* Scaling is instant
* Infrastructure is globally available

### Traditional IT vs Cloud

**Traditional Infrastructure**

* Physical servers
* Fixed capacity
* High upfront investment
* Manual scaling
* Hardware failures impact applications

**Cloud Infrastructure**

* Virtualized resources
* Elastic scaling
* No upfront cost
* High availability by design
* Managed data centers

Cloud allows organizations to **focus on applications**, not infrastructure.

---

## 3. Cloud Service Models

Cloud services are categorized based on **who manages what**.

### IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

* Provides virtual servers, storage, and networking
* User manages OS, runtime, and applications
* Example services: EC2, EBS, VPC

Use case:

* Full control over OS
* Custom software installations
* Lift-and-shift migrations

---

### PaaS – Platform as a Service

* AWS manages infrastructure and platform
* User manages only application code
* Example services: Elastic Beanstalk, RDS

Use case:

* Faster application deployment
* Reduced operational overhead

---

### SaaS – Software as a Service

* Complete software delivered over internet
* No infrastructure or platform management
* Example: AWS Trusted Advisor, Amazon WorkMail

Use case:

* End-user applications
* No technical maintenance required

---

## 4. Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

* Infrastructure shared among multiple customers
* Example: AWS
* Most cost-effective and scalable

### Private Cloud

* Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization
* Higher cost
* Used for strict compliance needs

### Hybrid Cloud

* Combination of on-premises and cloud
* Used during migration phases

### Multi-Cloud

* Multiple cloud providers used together
* Avoids vendor lock-in

---

## 5. What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud platform that provides **on-demand IT services** including compute, storage, databases, networking, security, analytics, and DevOps tools.

Key points:

* Launched in 2006
* Market leader in cloud computing
* Used by startups, enterprises, and governments
* Offers 200+ fully managed services

AWS follows:

* Pay-as-you-go pricing
* Global infrastructure
* High availability and fault tolerance

---

## 6. AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS infrastructure is designed for **high availability**, **low latency**, and **fault isolation**.

### Regions

* A Region is a physical geographic location
* Example: Mumbai (ap-south-1)
* Regions are isolated from each other
* Choice depends on latency, compliance, and cost

---

### Availability Zones (AZs)

* Each region contains multiple AZs
* AZ = independent data center
* Separate power, networking, cooling

Purpose:

* High availability
* Disaster recovery
* Fault tolerance

---

### Edge Locations

* Used for content delivery (CDN)
* Cached content delivered closer to users
* Improves performance and reduces latency

---

## 7. AWS Shared Responsibility Model

Security in AWS is a **shared responsibility**.

### AWS Responsibilities (Security *of* the Cloud)

* Physical data centers
* Hardware
* Networking infrastructure
* Hypervisor
* Physical security

---

### Customer Responsibilities (Security *in* the Cloud)

* Operating system patching
* IAM users and permissions
* Security groups and network ACLs
* Application security
* Data encryption
* Backup configuration

**Key principle:**
AWS secures the infrastructure, customers secure their resources and data.

---

## 8. AWS Core Service Categories (Overview)

### Compute

* EC2 – Virtual servers
* Lambda – Serverless compute
* ECS / EKS – Container services

---

### Storage

* S3 – Object storage
* EBS – Block storage
* EFS – File storage

---

### Database

* RDS – Managed relational databases
* DynamoDB – NoSQL key-value store

---

### Networking

* VPC – Virtual network
* Subnets
* Route Tables
* Internet Gateway
* NAT Gateway

---

### Security

* IAM – Identity and Access Management
* KMS – Key management
* CloudTrail – API auditing

This overview helps learners understand **where each service fits**.

---

## 9. AWS Pricing Fundamentals

AWS pricing is based on:

* Resource usage
* Time
* Data transfer
* Service type

Key pricing concepts:

* No upfront cost
* Pay only for what you use
* Per-second or per-hour billing
* Free tier for learning

Common billing mistakes:

* Leaving EC2 instances running
* Unused EBS volumes
* NAT Gateway costs
* Multiple public IPs

Understanding pricing early prevents **unexpected bills**.

---

## 10. AWS Account Structure & Root User

### Root User

* Created when AWS account is created
* Has full access to all services
* Should never be used for daily work

---

### IAM User

* Created for daily operations
* Permissions assigned via policies
* Follows least-privilege principle

Best practices:

* Enable MFA on root user
* Create IAM users for admins
* Use groups for permission management
* Enable billing alerts

---

## 11. AWS Management Interfaces

AWS can be accessed using multiple methods.

### AWS Management Console

* Web-based UI
* Best for beginners
* Easy visualization of resources

---

### AWS CLI

* Command-line interface
* Used for automation
* Requires access keys

---

### AWS SDK

* Programmatic access
* Used inside applications

---

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Terraform
* CloudFormation
* Used for repeatable deployments
